# Evocative Subgenres

Dividing up trance music evocatively versus by subgenre/artist/decade.

Imagine a two dimensional grid. One axis goes from *chthonic* to *aethereal*. The other axis goes from *primordial* to *transcendental*.

- *Chthonic* refers to trance that feels earthly and driven by earthly desires
- *Aethereal* refers to trance that feels celestial or driven by metaphysical desires
- *Primordial* refers to trance that feels like it is a reflection of the raw, dawning, material universe
- *Transcendental* refers to trance that feels like a reflection of the immaterial or spiritual world

The first axis represents whether the music "sounds" more of the earth or of the sky and stars and the second axis represents whether the music "sounds" more of a young material universe or of something outside of the material realm entirely.

Not everything will be neatly divisible and there will be overlap, but I think it's kind of interesting way to think about it. I noticed I already draw these distinctions on my own and I decided to try and actually write it out and give the spectrum cool names.

Also this doesn't just go for trance but really any music that's compositional and doesn't rely so much on a band's story and lyrics (which can muddy pure evocativeness, I think). Anything where the music is more evocative then it is literal I think can use this, although trance definitely went down this path as a genre much more shamelessy of being super-trippy and bubbling over with emotional cues.

# Examples

## Chthonic and Transcendental

This is the kind of trance that pumps people up. It's driving and uplifting, or if not uplifting at least excitingly melodic. Probably the kind of trance most people get into first.

This kind of trance can be closely related to "Aethereal and Primordial". The distinction I draw is that "Chthonic and Transcendental" is music that feels like it's being played inside of the Platonic cave right at the point of "waking up" and seeing the light outside of the cave, whereas "Aethereal and Primordial" music feels as though it is being played from outside the cave while looking back in.

## Chthonic and Primordial

This is all the music that has an edgy and dark vibe to it. It's music that evokes prehistoric earthly chaos. Vaguely hellish at times. The id of the four. This genre includes a lot of really trippy psy/goa.

- Point Zero - Li Kwan

## Aethereal and Transcendental

This is the kind of trance that is emotional. Maybe sometimes uplifting, but also often melancholy. This is the kind of trance that is just completely heady on all levels. It feels like it's about everything and nothing and feels like it's being made in some melancholy version of heaven.

This is also the combo probably most filled with "cheesy" female vocals that can be divisive between lovers and haters of vocal trance. It also may usurp from "Aethereal and Primordial"'s balearic dominance with regards to some chillout/trip-hoppy songs that have a balearic feel.

- Let Healing Begin - Liam Wilson
- As The Rush Comes - Motorcycle
- Southern Sun - Paul Oakenfold
- No Ordinary Morning - Chicane

## Aethereal and Primordial

This combo includes a lot of balearic trance. The reason balearic trance is generally aethereal and not chthonic, in spite of it's frequently "organic" nature, is that the vibe of the music has a more aethereal quality. It evokes a feeling of natural beauty (primordial) yet with a feeling of airyness (aethereal).

One overarching theme of this combo is that a lot of the music feels like it could be used in a science museum at like a planetarium show or something. Obviously this is an exaggeration, some of it is too ridiculous to be used in that context, but certain tracks, if stripped down a bit, do give off that feeling. I believe this is because a lot of the tracks have a strong vibe of human achievement mixed with human insignificance.
