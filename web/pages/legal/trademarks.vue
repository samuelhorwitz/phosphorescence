        <h2>Trademark Policy</h2>
        <h3>1. What does this policy apply to?</h3>
            <h4>1.1 The "Phosphorescence marks"</h4>
                <p>This policy applies to all trademarks of the Phosphorescence creator.
                The trademarks are unregistered trademarks, including non-stylized
                wordmarks and the trade dress of the Phosphorescence website.
                Non-exhaustively, this list includes the double-bordered Phosphorescence
                logo, the tri-colored "P" logo, the "vivid sunrise" edited photograph,
                and it's derivative non-photographic "sunrise gradient". In this policy,
                we refer to them as the "Phosphorescence marks" or just "marks."</p>
            <h4>1.2 "Use" of the Phosphorescence marks</h4>
                <p>This Policy applies whenever you want to use the Phosphorescence marks.
                Section 2 of this policy applies to all uses of the marks. Other
                sections apply only to uses that do not require separate permission, or
                uses that require a trademark license. If some term in your trademark
                license is inconsistent with this policy, you should follow the license
                terms.</p>
            <h4>1.3 "We" or the "Phosphorescence creator"</h4>
                <p>This Policy regulates the use of marks held by the Phosphorescence
                creator, Samuel Horwitz. Sometimes, this policy simply refers to the
                Phosphorescence creator or Samuel Horwitz as "we."</p>
            <h4>1.4 "You"</h4>
                <p>This Policy applies to "you" if you want to use the Phosphorescence
                marks and explains how you may use them. You may be any individual or
                organization. It is important that the Phosphorescence marks are not
                misleadingly used to market others' products because that will confuse
                Phosphorescence users.</p>
        <h3>2. How to use the Phosphorescence marks</h3>
            <p>Please follow generally accepted best design practices when using any of our
            marks whether with or without a trademark license. That is to say, do not
            modify or crowd logos and use all wordmarks in their full form and properly
            capitalized. When reasonable, please include this notice when you use a
            Phosphorescence mark:</p>

                <blockquote><p>"[Phosphorescence Wordmark / name of logo as listed here] is a trademark
                of Samuel Horwitz and is used with the permission of Samuel Horwitz. We
                are not endorsed by or affiliated with either Samuel Horwitz or
                Phosphorescence."</p></blockquote>

            <p>The notice should appear near the first use of a Phosphorescence mark. One
            notice is enough if you display multiple marks, provided the notice refers
            to all of them.</p>

            <p>If the mark will primarily appear on a mobile screen or another medium with
            limited visual space, you may instead use a trademark symbol (â„¢) with the
            mark to show that it is a Phosphorescence trademark. When you use a symbol
            due to limited space and there are additional pages to your material, please
            include the notice in the text of a prominent page (e.g., most mobile apps
            have an "about us" section and may display terms during installation).</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you use a notice or a trademark symbol to identify
            your use of Phosphorescence marks, please make sure that your use does not
            suggest endorsement by or affiliation with the Phosphorescence creator.</p>
        <h3>3. When you may use the Phosphorescence marks without asking us</h3>
            <h4>3.1 Discussing something other than Phosphorescence (fair use)</h4>
                <p>Wordmarks can sometimes have a primary meaning, in addition to
                representing a brand (like the words "apple" or "facebook"). Some of our
                wordmarks fall under this (e.g., "phosphorescence"). We will interpret
                fair use broadly to include the use of our wordmarks when you clearly
                mean to talk about something other than Phosphorescence.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Refer to Phosphorescence (nominative use)</h4>
                <p>You can use the non-stylized wordmarks (e.g., "Phosphorescence") to
                describe:</p>

                <ul><li>Phosphorescence in a text (e.g., "I love listening to trance music on
                  Phosphorescence").</li></ul>

                <p>You may use all Phosphorescence marks on your own website as a hyperlink
                to the Phosphorescence site. The use of logos in hyperlinks should
                follow the generally accepted best practices of respecting visual
                identity (e.g., the marks may be resized, but not modified in any other
                way).</p>

                <p>Here are some other specific cases of nominative use:</p>
                <h5>3.2.1 News reporting</h5>
                    <p>You may use the Phosphorescence marks to make truthful statements
                    about Phosphorescence in news reports and commentary.</p>
                <h5>3.2.2 Personal blogs and social media</h5>
                    <p>You may use the Phosphorescence marks to make or illustrate truthful
                    statements about Phosphorescence in personal blogs and social media.
                    But please do not do it to imply endorsement by or affiliation with
                    the Phosphorescence creator. To avoid confusion, do not use the
                    Phosphorescence logos in the background, as your profile image, or
                    in the header of your blog, in the name of your blog, or in your
                    social media username.</p>
                <h5>3.2.3 Artistic, scientific, literary, political, and other non-
                      commercial uses</h5>
                    <p>You can use the Phosphorescence marks to discuss Phosphorescence in
                    artistic, scientific, literary, and political work.</p>

                    <p>But please send us a request if you want to place a Phosphorescence
                    mark on the cover of your book, display a Phosphorescence mark in a
                    movie, or organize an event or presentation that could be
                    interpreted to be endorsed by the Phosphorescence creator. For more
                    information, please see Section 4.</p>

                    <p>You may use the marks in satire or jokes. To avoid confusing users
                    that your work is affiliated with Phosphorescence, it may be helpful
                    to mark your work as "satire" or "parody."</p>
        <h3>4. Special uses that require permission</h3>
            <p>All uses that are not allowed under Section 3 or prohibited by Section 5 of
            this policy require a trademark license. This section discusses only the
            most common uses that require a license.</p>

            <p>When you use our marks under a trademark license, you need to comply with
            its terms as well as with this trademark policy. If some term in your
            license is inconsistent with this policy, you should follow that license
            term.</p>
            <h4>4.1 Events and conferences</h4>
                <p>You need a trademark license if you plan to host a public event or a
                conference that uses a Phosphorescence mark.</p>

                <p>When you obtain a trademark license, it will apply only to the specific
                event in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if you
                want to host another event.</p>
            <h4>4.2 Publications</h4>
                <p>You need a trademark license if you want to use a Phosphorescence mark
                in a publication, unless your use qualifies as fair or nominative use
                under U.S. trademark law or other applicable foreign laws.</p>

                <p>When you obtain a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific
                publication in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if
                you want to make another publication.</p>
            <h4>4.3 Movies &amp; TV shows</h4>
                <p>You need a trademark license to use the Phosphorescence logo in a movie,
                TV show episode, or online production.</p>

                <p>When you obtain a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific
                film, TV show episode, or online production in your request. You will
                need to apply for a new license if you want to shoot another film or TV
                show episode.</p>
        <h3>5. Prohibited uses</h3>
            <h4>5.1 Misleading mirrors and mimicking sites</h4>
                <p>Please do not create a website that mimics the "look and feel" of the
                Phosphorescence site.</p>
            <h4>5.2 Linking to non-Phosphorescence sites</h4>
                <p>You may use Phosphorescence marks to link to Phosphorescence only.</p>
            <h4>5.3 Misrepresentation</h4>
                <p>When you use a Phosphorescence mark under this policy, please use it to
                represent only the project for which it stands. Please do not create the
                impression that your use is in any way endorsed, sponsored by, or is
                part of the Phosphorescence creator. This section also applies when you
                are granted a license to use a mark that doesn't permit you to suggest
                such an endorsement.</p>
        <h3>6. Trademark Misuse</h3>
            <h4>6.1 Reporting misuse</h4>
                <p>Fighting trademark misuse is very important. If you see a mark being
                used in any way that could be infringing, please tell us! Just send an
                email to <a href="mailto:trademarks@phosphor.me">trademarks@phosphor.me</a>. We really appreciate your help!</p>
            <h4>6.2 Revoking permission for misuses</h4>
                <p>We may revoke the right to use the Phosphorescence marks under this
                policy at any time by providing notice in any manner if we determine
                that a trademark use is inconsistent with our mission or could harm
                community members, or the Phosphorescence creator.</p>
        <h3>7. Revision and Translation of the trademark policy</h3>
            <h4>7.1 This trademark policy can be revised as follows:</h4>
                <p>This trademark policy may be revised without notice.</p>

                version of this trademark policy and a translation, you should follow
                the original English version.</p>
