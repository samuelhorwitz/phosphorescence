Trademark Policy

1. What does this policy apply to?
    1.1 The "Phosphorescence marks"
        This policy applies to all trademarks of the Phosphorescence creator.
        The trademarks are unregistered trademarks, including non-stylized
        wordmarks and the trade dress of the Phosphorescence website.
        Non-exhaustively, this list includes the double-bordered Phosphorescence
        logo, the tri-colored "P" logo, the "vivid sunrise" edited photograph,
        and it's derivative non-photographic "sunrise gradient". In this policy,
        we refer to them as the "Phosphorescence marks" or just "marks."
    1.2 "Use" of the Phosphorescence marks
        This Policy applies whenever you want to use the Phosphorescence marks.
        Section 2 of this policy applies to all uses of the marks. Other
        sections apply only to uses that do not require separate permission, or
        uses that require a trademark license. If some term in your trademark
        license is inconsistent with this policy, you should follow the license
        terms.
    1.3 "We" or the "Phosphorescence creator"
        This Policy regulates the use of marks held by the Phosphorescence
        creator, Samuel Horwitz. Sometimes, this policy simply refers to the
        Phosphorescence creator or Samuel Horwitz as "we."
    1.4 "You"
        This Policy applies to "you" if you want to use the Phosphorescence
        marks and explains how you may use them. You may be any individual or
        organization. It is important that the Phosphorescence marks are not
        misleadingly used to market others' products because that will confuse
        Phosphorescence users.
2. How to use the Phosphorescence marks
    Please follow generally accepted best practices when using any of our marks
    whether with or without a trademark license. That is to say, do not modify
    or crowd logos and use all wordmarks in their full form and properly
    capitalized. When reasonable, please include this notice when you use a
    Phosphorescence mark:

        "[Phosphorescence Wordmark / name of logo as listed here] is a trademark
        of Samuel Horwitz and is used with the permission of Samuel Horwitz. We
        are not endorsed by or affiliated with either Samuel Horwitz or
        Phosphorescence."

    The notice should appear near the first use of a Phosphorescence mark. One
    notice is enough if you display multiple marks, provided the notice refers
    to all of them.

    If the mark will primarily appear on a mobile screen or another medium with
    limited visual space, you may instead use a trademark symbol (™) with the
    mark to show that it is a Phosphorescence trademark. When you use a symbol
    due to limited space and there are additional pages to your material, please
    include the notice in the text of a prominent page (e.g., most mobile apps
    have an "about us" section and may display terms during installation).

    Regardless of whether you use a notice or a trademark symbol to identify
    your use of Phosphorescence marks, please make sure that your use does not
    suggest endorsement by or affiliation with the Phosphorescence creator.
3. When you may use the Phosphorescence marks without asking us
    3.1 Discussing something other than Phosphorescence (fair use)
        Wordmarks can sometimes have a primary meaning, in addition to
        representing a brand (like the words "apple" or "facebook"). Some of our
        wordmarks fall under this (e.g., "phosphorescence"). We will interpret
        fair use broadly to include the use of our wordmarks when you clearly
        mean to talk about something other than Phosphorescence.
    3.2 Refer to Phosphorescence (nominative use)
        You can use the non-stylized wordmarks (e.g., "Phosphorescence") to
        describe:

        - Phosphorescence in a text (e.g., "I love listening to trance music on
          Phosphorescence").

        You may use all Phosphorescence marks on your own website as a hyperlink
        to the Phosphorescence site. The use of logos in hyperlinks should
        follow the generally accepted best practices of respecting visual
        identity (e.g., the marks may be resized, but not modified in any other
        way).

        Here are some other specific cases of nominative use:
        3.2.1 News reporting
            You may use the Phosphorescence marks to make truthful statements
            about Phosphorescence in news reports and commentary.
        3.2.2 Personal blogs and social media
            You may use the Phosphorescence marks to make or illustrate truthful
            statements about Phosphorescence in personal blogs and social media.
            But please do not do it to imply endorsement by or affiliation with
            the Phosphorescence creator. To avoid confusion, do not use the
            Phosphorescence logos in the background, as your profile image, or
            in the header of your blog, in the name of your blog, or in your
            social media username.
        3.2.3 Artistic, scientific, literary, political, and other non-
              commercial uses
            You can use the Phosphorescence marks to discuss Phosphorescence in
            artistic, scientific, literary, and political work.

            But please send us a request if you want to place a Phosphorescence
            mark on the cover of your book, display a Phosphorescence mark in a
            movie, or organize an event or presentation that could be
            interpreted to be endorsed by the Phosphorescence creator. For more
            information, please see Section 4.

            You may use the marks in satire or jokes. To avoid confusing users
            that your work is affiliated with Phosphorescence, it may be helpful
            to mark your work as "satire" or "parody."
4. Special uses that require permission
    All uses that are not allowed under Section 3 or prohibited by Section 5 of
    this policy require a trademark license. This section discusses only the
    most common uses that require a license.

    When you use our marks under a trademark license, you need to comply with
    its terms as well as with this trademark policy. If some term in your
    license is inconsistent with this policy, you should follow that license
    term.
    4.1 Events and conferences
        You need a trademark license if you plan to host a public event or a
        conference that uses a Phosphorescence mark.

        When you obtain a trademark license, it will apply only to the specific
        event in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if you
        want to host another event.
    4.2 Publications
        You need a trademark license if you want to use a Phosphorescence mark
        in a publication, unless your use qualifies as fair or nominative use
        under U.S. trademark law or other applicable foreign laws.

        When you obtain a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific
        publication in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if
        you want to make another publication.
    4.3 Movies & TV shows
        You need a trademark license to use the Phosphorescence logo in a movie,
        TV show episode, or online production.

        When you obtain a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific
        film, TV show episode, or online production in your request. You will
        need to apply for a new license if you want to shoot another film or TV
        show episode.
5. Prohibited uses
    5.1 Misleading mirrors and mimicking sites
        Please do not create a website that mimics the "look and feel" of the
        Phosphorescence site.
    5.2 Linking to non-Phosphorescence sites
        You may use Phosphorescence marks to link to Phosphorescence only.
    5.3 Misrepresentation
        When you use a Phosphorescence mark under this policy, please use it to
        represent only the project for which it stands. Please do not create the
        impression that your use is in any way endorsed, sponsored by, or is
        part of the Phosphorescence creator. This section also applies when you
        are granted a license to use a mark that doesn't permit you to suggest
        such an endorsement.
6. Trademark Misuse
    6.1 Reporting misuse
        Fighting trademark misuse is very important. If you see a mark being
        used in any way that could be infringing, please tell us! Just send an
        email to trademarks@phosphor.me. We really appreciate your help!
    6.2 Revoking permission for misuses
        We may revoke the right to use the Phosphorescence marks under this
        policy at any time by providing notice in any manner if we determine
        that a trademark use is inconsistent with our mission or could harm
        community members, or the Phosphorescence creator.
7. Revision and Translation of the trademark policy
    7.1 This trademark policy can be revised as follows:
        This trademark policy may be revised without notice.
    7.2 Translation of the trademark policy
        If there are any differences in meaning between the original English
        version of this trademark policy and a translation, you should follow
        the original English version.
    7.3 Questions
        Please do not hesitate to contact us at trademarks@phosphor.me if you
        are not sure whether your use is in compliance with this policy or local
        trademark laws.
